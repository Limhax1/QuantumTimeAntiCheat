# Quantum Time Anticheat

A fork of [Medusa](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/medusa-anticheat-fast-and-reliable-detections-3-2-reach-detection.83345/) with many stability and performance improvements, and brand new checks.

> Why does this project exist?
> 
Because we've seen the potential in the Original anticheat and wanted to improve its stability and accuracy.

> What did we change?
> 
We have deleted all of the original checks while still using the original codebase and api, made new checks from scratch, optimized the original code and improved dataprocessing accuracy.

> Where can I test the anticheat?
> 
Our test server is now open, join with the ip 213.181.206.22:8350
