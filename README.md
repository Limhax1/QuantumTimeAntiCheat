# Quantum Time Anticheat

![QTAC2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9840a29c-0f6c-4303-9c80-ddd97d6b60e3)

A fork of [Medusa](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/medusa-anticheat-fast-and-reliable-detections-3-2-reach-detection.83345/) with many stability and performance improvements, and brand new checks.

> Why does this project exist?
> 
Because we've seen the potential in the Original anticheat and wanted to improve its stability and accuracy.

> What did we change?
> 
We have deleted all of the original checks while still using the original codebase and api, made new checks from scratch, optimized the original code and improved dataprocessing accuracy.
